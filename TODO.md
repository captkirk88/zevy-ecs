### What to do...

- [ ] Explore threading when Zig's threading model is more mature, this will not be trivial...
  - Specifically the newer std.Io APIs
  - Separate branch for experimentation using zig 0.16.0+
  - main branch will be stuck to zig 0.15.1
- [x] New project repo zevy_raylib using zevy_ecs and raylib-zig
  - Test zevy_ecs in a more real world scenario that helps find bugs and ideas for improvements
