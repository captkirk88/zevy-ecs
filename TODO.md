### What to do...

- [ ] Explore threading when Zig's threading model is more mature, this will not be trivial...
  - Specifically the newer std.Io APIs
- [ ] New project repo zevy_raylib using zevy_ecs and raylib-zig
  - Test zevy_ecs in a more real world scenario that helps find bugs and ideas for improvements
